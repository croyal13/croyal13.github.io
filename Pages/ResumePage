    <p>The past few summers I've been a camp counselor for two camps, First Chance  Bible Camp (2nd-3rd Grade) and Junior Bible Camp (4th-6th Grade), both at Pleasant Valley Christian Camp in Mineral, Washington</p>
    <p>Summer of 2015 I spent about two or so weeks helping a Christian bookstore, By The Well, get ready for opening. Most of the time I worked on prepping the shelving as well as stocking the shelves and racks prior to opening day.</p>
