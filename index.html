        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>I'm a 2nd generation college student studying Visual Communication Design with a minor in Business Administration at Eastern Washington University. I enjoy music and art as I can play a handful of various musical instruments and spending time sketching and drawing.  </p>
        
        <h3>Professional Objectives</h3>
        <p>My professional objective is to get a job in the field of what I have been studying at Eastern Washington University: Graphic Design (VCD). It has always been my dream, however, to find a way to incorporate my love for music with my love for design and to find a profession that deals with both interests.</p>
